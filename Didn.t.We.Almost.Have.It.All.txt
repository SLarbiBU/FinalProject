Previously on Grey's Anatomy: You are taking a test that will determine the course of your entire medical careers.
- Want a big wedding? - Yes.
I know you think I have feelings for you, but I don't.
- Search and Rescue found lost climbers.
- One's still missing.
Tell me.
Do you remember? Do you know who you are? He's making his recommendation to the board.
Chief of Surgery and Chief Resident.
- You're adopting? - She hasn't picked us yet.
This heartburn.
It's like - Fourth climber.
- Is that an ax in his head? If Richard finds out you're carrying another man's baby Somebody help! Being Chief is about responsibility.
Every single surgical patient in the hospital is your patient.
Whether you're the one who cut them open or not.
She lost a lot of blood! The scalpel stops with you.
Start two large bore IV's and bolus two liters LR.
Need to be able to look at a family Ready? One, two and tell 'em your team did everything they could to save someone's child.
Get me a stat EKG and portable chest.
- She's 34 weeks pregnant with twins.
- Their husband - Why don't you go to the waiting room? - We're not leaving her.
Their wife - What happened? - I don't know.
I found her unconscious.
You get caught up.
Taking care of other people's families.
She's lost blood.
A lot of blood.
And the responsibility, it makes you I didn't know she was in the hospital.
What she was doing? You take care of other people's families.
And you sacrifice your own.
Thought I was gonna hate this party game thing, but it's great.
- Can we set her on fire after? - No, we cannot.
- These wedding vows aren't gonna fit.
- Write smaller.
Hold still, please.
"Thou" just became "Cow.
"' You don't need vows on your hand.
Just speak from the heart.
Izzie, the heart is an organ.
It pumps, circulates blood, gets clogged from time to time.
It does not speak.
It doesn't have tiny little lips on it.
You're all "glass totally empty.
"' I'm going to like being married.
It's the wedding part that's ridiculous.
- The party's over.
- Damn.
Hey, mine didn't go off.
Piece of crap.
You can do this, right? Become a piece of chattel? Sure.
Looking forward to it.
No matter what, you're walking down that aisle.
I need you to go down that aisle.
- Toilet paper cutting off circulation? - You marrying Burke? It's a sign.
A sign that people like you and me can do this.
Be healthy.
Be happy.
You marrying Burke restores my faith in me.
- Oh, I get it.
My wedding's about you.
- Yes.
- OK.
- You can do this, right? - I can do this.
- OK They found the fourth climber.
Vitals are stabilizing after fluids, but - I thought he was dead - Friends said he was.
CT show a bleed? - We haven't done a CT yet.
- You said it was head trauma.
Yeah, there's been a little head trauma.
Ice ax to the head.
What the hell happened up on that mountain? That's a good question.
You don't think it could be uterine cancer, do you? It runs in the family.
No.
It's not.
She was in earlier.
She was in a fender-bender.
My wife came into my hospital and you neglected to tell me? Doctor/patient confidentiality.
We're still married.
She's unconscious.
There are medical decisions to be made.
Legally, I have the right to know.
I have a right She might be having a miscarriage.
She's pregnant.
I need to know what time your chest pains started.
I don't know.
Yesterday afternoon.
What time exactly? This is important.
Around three o'clock.
What's wrong with me? I'm going to explain everything to you.
But, right now, we need to get you up to the surgical floor.
Surgery? What about my babies? I think those babies are coming out today.
But I haven't decided.
I haven't chosen parents.
I need time to decide.
You don't need to decide anything right now.
Right now the most important thing is making sure that you're OK.
All right? Burke.
I've got a surgery.
It shouldn't take me more than four hours, five tops.
- I could scrub in.
- How's Rina? Need to get a CT angio, but I'm pretty sure it's a tear in her aorta.
Heart is about to blow.
Most dissecting aortas burst within 48 hours.
We have less than 12 hours to fix it before she's dead.
- Need me to get the babies out.
- So I can save her.
You have an aortic dissection? Yeah.
I promise I will make it to the chapel in time.
I OK.
Listen up.
O'Malley, you're with Shepherd and Sloan.
Stevens, you're with Burke, Karev, Addison.
Go.
- Grey, you are with the chief's wife.
- The chief's wife? Is pregnant.
Yes, I did say pregnant.
I recommend you lose the shocked look and try for something a little more dignified.
Go.
Who am I on? I didn't page you.
Go home, get some sleep.
But I'm here, so You're getting married in less than 12 hours.
Give us room! Burke's getting married and he gets to operate.
- There's only one Preston Burke.
- There's only one Cristina Yang.
I've given you the day off.
The whole day.
It's a kindness.
Take it.
It's your wedding day.
Always be more surgeries.
What would you rather be doing? Prepping a patient or for your wedding? Go home.
I never got the sense you wanted the job.
Seems to me you got in the race to play out some kind of unfinished business you have with Derek.
I was in this to win, sir.
I don't know if he's your new Chief, but if he is, he got there because I made him fight for it.
You made them all fight for it.
- So I'm not going to be Chief? - No, you're not.
They recovered Lonnie's body? Not his body.
He's alive.
Why don't you tell me what really happened up there on the mountain.
We're halfway up this ice wall.
There's a There's a ledge a couple hundred feet above us.
We figured we'd set up the tents.
Wait out the storm.
Only Lonnie's insisting we go down the mountain.
I told him we got to dig in.
Sit tight.
He started freaking out.
Keeps saying down's the way to go.
Then he starts climbing down.
We were tied together, and just like that We're falling.
I swing out with my ax just trying to catch a rock.
I clip Lonnie in the back of the head.
The ax just snags.
We thought he was dead.
It was an accident.
- What happened? - You've been unconscious for a while.
What about? He knows.
You lost a lot of blood.
I'm going to try to find a heartbeat.
You should prepare yourself.
- Heartbeat.
- Oh, good.
It's a little slower than I'd like, but once we tank you with liquids and a transfusion, it might get stronger.
Got to rush off to surgery.
I'll be back with you the minute I'm done.
- Thank you.
- OK.
Adele, why didn't you tell me? Oh, come on, Richard.
What do you think you would have done? Congratulate me? I'm sure you have work to do.
I'm good right here.
Peds residents on-call will be in the OR for Rina's delivery.
Great.
Just make sure they notify the NICU.
Hi.
Sorry for interrupting.
The nurse said that you're Dr.
Montgomery? - Yes.
Can I help you with something? - I'm Jeff Pope.
Rebecca's husband.
Rebecca? - Rebecca? - Hi, Jeff.
You Your face But it's you.
I'm so sorry, baby.
I should've never let you go.
I'll never let you go again.
- Hey! - I have a surgery.
- I heard you're the best man.
- Yeah.
Maid of honor, best man, kind of perfect.
Yeah.
I know I haven't been myself lately, but I'm me again.
I was thinking you should sleep over 'cause the me that I am - is horny for the you that you are.
- I met a woman last night.
- You met a woman last night? - At Joe's.
Nothing happened.
She was pretty, I noticed and we talked.
- You met a woman last night.
- Yeah.
Should I be worried? Should you be worried that I met a woman? No.
Should you be worried that, for me, flirting with that woman was the highlight of my week? Yeah.
You should be worried or something.
- I don't understand.
- It's not you.
I understand that part.
What I don't understand is why? I need this job, Richard.
I need it more than the others.
- Addison.
- No, I need a reason to stay here.
I need a reason to get up.
I need to wake up and not care that it's raining or that I'm 39 and alone.
- I need the job, Richard.
- That's why.
If you need a job to give you a life, you either need a new job or a new life.
You know, I'm thinking four hours tops to repair this heart, if all goes well.
You're a lucky man, Burke.
Cristina's great.
She's there.
She's sure.
She's willing to commit.
You're a lucky man.
And you're not? There he is.
T minus five hours.
And how's the best man? Up to the challenge? I was an excellent best man.
Worst case scenario, I sleep with your wife in ten years.
OK.
I just checked.
Chief Resident hasn't been posted.
- No.
I wasn't looking for Chief - Yeah, you were.
Yeah.
OK, I was.
- George.
- Hey.
What I'm about to say is crazy and I I I am not responsible.
I am saying this against my will because I am a surgeon, OK? I love my job, I love my life exactly as it is.
OK, exactly as it is! - Understand? - Not really.
I have no desire to house a human being in my body for nine long months and then and then push it out and raise it, - OK? None.
Zero.
- OK.
Except housing a human for nine long months is all that I can think about.
The thoughts are invading the surgeries that I love and it's It's hormonal.
It's And horrible.
But it is happening.
To me.
- You want to have a baby? - Apparently.
There's a guy with an ax in his head Right.
Go.
It's I'm a freak.
Just go.
Just run.
Just - Thank you.
- Please.
Go.
I'm fine.
Take your pill and drink your water.
You know you want to go out that door and start bossing people around.
Take your pill, Adele.
See, I can do my bossing right from this chair.
Go ahead, Richard.
Ask.
I know you are dying to know whose baby Not really my place.
Mrs.
Webber, your room is ready.
Excuse me, what do you want to do about the announcement for Chief of Surgery? I will be right back.
I promise.
We've met before.
You probably don't remember.
You were little.
My husband always flirted with your mother.
I didn't want to see that, so I watched you a lot.
Watched you grow.
You turned out well.
I'm sorry about your mother.
I'm sorry about my mother too.
It wasn't your fault.
Maybe it wasn't anyone's fault.
We get married at 25 thinking, "this is it.
"' "Happily ever after.
"' Maybe there is no happily ever after.
It's stunning.
It's a little Is this supposed to be so tight? Well, it's a choker.
It's beautiful.
It's really, really beautiful.
I just don't know if it's me.
Five generations of Burke women have worn this on their wedding day.
It's a way of joining our family.
- Becoming a Burke.
- A Burke.
I'm afraid I misjudged you early on.
I thought you were selfish.
You've given way to his ideas about the wedding.
You've been flexible about the things that are most important to him.
And that is wonderful.
Oh, it's just What were you planning to do about your eyebrows? - Nothing.
- Uh-huh.
- How she doing? - BP's 92 over 56.
How's Jane Doe and her husband? Whatever.
He cried like a baby, she looked bored.
Don't go overboard with compassion.
She's not sure she wants to stay with him.
It's complicated.
It's not, actually.
Complicated.
They're married, she took a vow.
You don't mess with vows.
Married is married.
Game over.
So freaking over.
Just an opinion.
Pressure's dropped to 60.
She's bradying down! How much longer? I just need two minutes to get these babies out.
Make it one.
She's flatlined.
Start compressions.
- I got the first one out.
Clamp.
- Come on, come on.
- Second baby's out.
OK, go.
- Bulky, ten-blade.
Poor guy, he just wanted to climb, and he ends up with an ax in his head.
He shouldn't have tried turning back.
If the group goes up, you move with the group.
OK, drill, please.
He panicked.
Have a right to turn back if you're scared.
No.
He chose to climb a mountain.
You can't change your mind in the middle of a climb.
- OK.
- Now we pull it out? Yeah, but the ax went in as they fell.
So there'll be some tearing.
Should be a shallow wound.
It should come out easily.
- You got it? - Yep.
All right, everybody.
Here we go.
Ready? OK, one, two, three.
That's strange.
One, two, three.
- That's a clean cut.
- You said there was gonna be tearing.
I know.
That doesn't make sense.
You are a lucky guy.
Yeah.
Or the ax didn't go in there by accident.
It's probably unfair, but I hold you to a higher standard.
And you let me down this year, Preston.
After you got shot, the tremor.
This job is about making the tough calls.
Sometimes the toughest call you can make is admitting when you're in over your head.
You don't do that.
You know a lot, Preston.
You're one of the best surgeons I know.
One of the best men.
But you're not perfect.
You don't know everything.
I want to give you the job.
I want to.
But I can't.
- Preston.
- I have a wedding to get to.
Thank you.
The babies are doing great.
They're in the NICU.
How you doing up there, Preston? - Close call, but she's stabilized.
- Good work, Dr.
Burke.
We may actually get you to the church on time.
You nervous? No.
Not really.
More excited.
Except about my vows.
I wrote them myself.
And I don't know.
They may be too I want them to be right.
- Well, let's hear them.
- What? Now? Got a room full of women.
Try 'em out on us.
"Cristina, I could promise to hold you and to cherish you.
I could promise to be there in sickness and in health.
I could say, "Till death do us part.
"' But I won't.
Those vows are for optimistic couples, the ones full of hope.
And I do not stand here on my wedding day - optimistic or full of hope.
- OK, um I am not optimistic.
I am not hopeful.
I am sure.
I am steady.
And I know I am a heart man.
I take them apart, I put them back together.
I hold them in my hands.
I am a heart man.
So, of this, I am sure: You are my partner, my lover, my very best friend.
My heart, my heart, beats for you.
And on this day, the day of our wedding, I promise you this: I promise you to lay my heart in the palm of your hands.
I promise you me.
- Too trite? Because I can rewrite it.
- No.
No, it's I think I speak for every woman in this room when I say dump her.
Dump Yang and marry me.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, God! Did I miss a page? No, no, no, no, no.
Everything's OK.
- What? What's up? - Is this really what you want? Because if it's really what you want, we could do it.
- Really? - Yeah.
- OK, wait, really? - Really.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Really? - Really.
She looks like Rebecca.
Or, at least, what Rebecca used to look like.
- But still around the eyes.
- Yeah.
I thought I'd give her some space.
She seemed a little overwhelmed.
The ferry crash was on the news everywhere.
Your wife goes missing.
How could you not look for her? I thought she left me.
We got into a fight that night.
She was trying to tell me how unhappy she was and I shut her down.
Yeah, I didn't look for her when she was missing, but what's worse is, I didn't see her when she was there.
I can't imagine what it must have been like for her.
Her face must have looked all broken.
She was beautiful.
I love her.
You know? Meredith.
Oh, you are not going to believe Derek met a girl.
In a bar.
And he flirted with her.
He told me.
You know, no big deal.
- Thought I should know.
- Meredith.
I'm not exaggerating.
He didn't even hint.
He just flat-out told me.
You know how sometimes it's about you and sometimes it's about me? - This is really, really about me.
- Whoa.
Mama took my eyebrows.
She took my eyebrows, and now I am a Burke.
Lonnie's stable.
But the damage he sustained is significant.
- But is he going to wake up? - Do you want him to? What? The ax in his head was put there deliberately.
I want to give you three guys another opportunity to tell me the truth.
- It wasn't what - Shut up, Andy.
- But we can't just - I said shut up, Andy! Is that how you let him talk to you at 14,000 feet? I have to talk to his family.
You guys can talk to the cops.
- Dr.
Bailey? - Yeah? What? Cristina needs to cut something.
I can't really explain it in a way that won't make you glare.
But they took her eyebrows and they called her a Burke.
She really needs to cut somebody open.
Yang, go.
Do "getting married" things.
Get out of this hospital.
Hey! I mean, hey I You have to let me cut because I'm standing here eyebrow-less with no dignity left.
I'm a surgeon, Dr.
Bailey.
But right now, I don't feel like one.
I feel like somebody else.
Do you know what that's like? Not to feel like yourself? Yeah.
What's going on? Started cramping and then she got diaphoretic.
Alert OB to a possible D&C due to an incomplete miscarriage.
Adele, you could have a placental abruption due to the trauma.
We've got to get you to an OR now.
Let's move, people! Sir, Dr.
Shepherd is here.
Thank you.
Richard, are you sure you want to? You don't have to do this today.
Yes, I do.
She went into early DIC.
I gave her blood, platelets, FFP.
Pregnancy at 52 is dangerous.
I tried everything.
I couldn't save Ohh I thought I thought For a second I thought I'd lost you.
- Do you want to call somebody? I can - No.
No one.
Well, the father of the baby, maybe you want to He doesn't even know about it.
I didn't tell him.
I I think I misjudged him.
I thought he'd go running for the hills.
But, actually, he's a much better man than I thought.
He'll get over his initial judgments and he'll sit with you, and he'll make you drink your water.
- Adele.
- It was a boy.
I'm sorry.
Dr.
Leonard, would you please close for Dr.
Burke.
He has a wedding to get to.
One cut and then you're gone.
One.
I still have to You want your bride waiting for you? They don't like that.
Let's go.
- Got to go now, Cristina.
- Grey.
Put the scalpel down, Cristina.
You can still do this, right? - What? - Hold on a minute.
I just wanted to make sure no one's around so I can say this.
- We've said everything we need to say.
- Shut up.
I am an optimist.
I am hopeful.
I am not sure.
- Izzie, I can do this myself.
- Let me speak.
Because I'm your best friend and because I love you, if what you want is to be with Callie, then I will do everything in my power to support you.
And help you make your marriage work.
But because I'm your best friend and because I love you I also have to say that I'm in love with you.
I'm in love with you.
I can't promise the future, I can't promise perfection because we're us and I'm me and who knows what will happen.
But in my heart, I am sure.
I'm in love with you, George.
And I hope you're in love with me too.
Say something.
- What time is it? - Got 30 minutes.
- I'm gonna be late for my own wedding.
- No, we're not.
Dr.
Burke asked me to check on you.
Let's see here Post-op X-rays look good.
We'll discuss releasing you.
- Any change in Lonnie? - Andy.
- Who are you? - He's my lawyer.
That was fast.
Don't you dare judge me.
You weren't there.
We thought He was almost dead, no way he was going to make it.
He was in so much pain.
- So I picked it up and I put - Andy shut up! No! I'm not going to shut up.
I put him out of his misery.
And if I was back there right now, I'd do the same thing.
He was my friend.
He is my friend.
I put him out of his misery.
Got any deodorant? Not for your hairy armpits.
Don't move.
You're gonna have a unibrow.
I have some in my locker.
Closed? Open? - Closed.
Perfect.
Dashing.
- Thanks.
You look great.
- Moment of truth.
- Our scores? Grey.
Karev.
Yang.
Stevens.
O'Malley.
- Yes! - Right here, baby! Yes! Thank God! - Did you pass? - You bet your married booty I did.
How'd you do? Did you pass? Yeah.

OK.
- Oh, hey! Sorry.
Excuse me.
- Hey.
- Meredith? - I'll meet you at the chapel.
- You take the dress? - Yes.
- I'll be right there.
- OK.
I like the suit.
The suit is way better than the scrubs.
Thanks.
Hey, I passed my intern exam.
- Good! - Yeah.
That's good! We got discharged.
Me and the baby.
Oh, come on.
You just had brain surgery.
You're still on antibiotics.
My body's been signed off by plastics, cardio, orthopedics, neuro and OB.
And my teeth got the blessing from, wait, I can say this, prosthodontics.
Still, your memory Know how I know my memory's fine? I can say prosthodontics.
- Yeah, but the baby.
- Discharged by peds.
Yeah, but I have every reason to go.
And yeah, I'm scared and, yeah, this is moving at warp speed and I'm freaking out.
But Jeff is good and Jeff is the father of my child.
The man is out buying a car seat right now.
The minute he gets back I have every reason to go.
Because medically, there's no need for me to stay.
Medically.
Oh.
Yeah.
OK.
Well, then I'll just check the chart and we'll see what, - what might - Damn it.
- What? - Are you? Do I Do I have to spell everything out for you? Did you sniff too much glue as a child? I'm asking you something here.
What do you want from me? I want I want you to give me a reason to stay.
A real reason.
Jeff's Jeff's a decent guy.
A good, decent guy.
But to him, I'm Rebecca.
I don't know if I am Rebecca anymore.
You know me.
You knew when I couldn't even speak who I was.
You You named me Ava and I was more me as Ava than I'll ever be as Rebecca.
I mean, look, I have every reason to go back to my life.
And I will.
Unless you Alex, I'm asking you to give me a reason to stay here.
A reason from you.
Jeff loves you, he's a He's a decent guy.
Alex, give me a reason.
I think you should stick with the decent guy.
If you want to break up with me so you can see other women, just do it.
Don't tell me you met another woman.
Just end it, if that's what you want.
I can't.
Sure you can.
Here's how it goes.
"I don't want to see you anymore.
Meredith, I don't love you anymore.
"' Meredith I do love you.
Don't you see? Don't you understand? You're the love of my life.
I can't leave you.
But you're constantly leaving me.
You walk away when you want, you come back when you want.
Not everyone.
Not your friends.
But you leave me.
So I'm asking you, if you don't see a future for us, if you're not in this Please please just end it because I can't.
I'm in it.
Put me out of my misery.
I can't.
Cris Cristina's getting married.
I have to go make sure she gets married.
Meredith.
I really need to make sure she gets down that aisle.
Let's go.
We're running late.
- You OK? - I'm fine.
Fine.
You need anything? Need a mint? Getaway car? If it's the chief thing, don't worry.
You deserve it.
Richard didn't pick me to be Chief.
We all assumed Well, who did he pick? I don't know.
It wasn't me.
Oh, you really don't look so good.
Meredith and I, we may not make it.
I think I want it more than she does.
But today's your day.
It's all about you today.
- You really are a good best man.
- I'm trying.
Cristina.
- Cristina? - I didn't run.
You look beautiful.
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.
Frankly, I always feared you were too emotionally stunted to settle down.
You can do this.
I always found it confusing.
If you know both the bride and the groom, whose side do you sit on? I look for the hottest chick and sit next to her.
- Stop.
- Wanna ditch the reception? - Grab a drink instead? - Stop it.
You don't want me.
- Maybe I do.
- No, you don't.
You want Ava.
She's not Ava anymore.
She's Rebecca now.
I barely know her.
Look at me.
Look at me.
You suck.
To me, you suck.
I kind of hate you.
But, Alex? We do not get unlimited chances to have the things we want.
And this I know.
Nothing is worse than missing an opportunity that could have changed your life.
And no matter what her name is, she'll always be Ava to you.
Dr.
Bailey? - You didn't go to the wedding either.
- No.
I am so sorry, George.
So What do I do now? You fail your intern test, you have two options.
You can walk away from being a surgical resident altogether.
Or you can start from the very beginning.
Repeat my internship? No.
I can't.
I can't.
- Did I Did I fail you, George? - No.
No.
I failed you.
Oh, it looks so pretty in there.
I see Burke.
Yang.
The twins look nice in that dress.
Thank you.
Sort of.
- Gotta go.
Congrats.
- You're on call? Wait! Alex, did you see George in there? I don't see him.
He's probably going to be late.
We had kind of had a big emotional day.
- Really? - Yeah.
Did something happen between you two? I mean Just that I was named Chief Resident.
Plus, we decided to have a baby.
- A baby? - We're trying.
We tried today, in fact.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
Big day.
- This is it.
- Yeah.
- OK? - Yeah.
- Have the bouquet? - Yeah.
- I have the ring.
- Yeah.
Remember your vows? - Yeah, I wrote them on my - OK.
Oh, my God.
I scrubbed in.
I scrubbed in.
The vows were on my hand.
I scrubbed off my vows.
Oh.
OK, um Hello! Scrubbed off my vows.
I can't do this.
I don't have anything on my hand! I should go see what's going on.
Cristina wouldn't be Cristina if she didn't need a little push.
There are no words in my head.
OK, I have no vows.
No vows! It's OK.
It's going to be OK.
Stop saying that! Will you say something else? - Like what? - Say something that's going to help! OK! OK! I Meredith! Please! Say something! Say Say OK, say what I would say to you if you were me.
- OK.
- Good.
- Got it.
- Good.
Go.
Stop whining! This is your wedding day! You will go down that aisle and get married if I have to kick your ass every step to get you there.
You will walk down the aisle, you will get married.
Do you hear me? We need this.
We need you to get your happy ending.
- OK.
I'm ready.
- All right then.

I'm fine.
Meredith talked me down.
I'm fine.
Go.
I'll be right behind.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no.
I can do this.
You know, I had a momentary freak out, but now I'm fine.
- I can do this.
Come on.
- But you don't want to do this.
I'm up there waiting for you to come down the aisle.
And I know you don't want to come.
I know you don't want to come, but that you'll come anyway because you love me.
And if I loved you, if I loved you, not the woman that I'm trying to make you be, not the woman that I hope you'll become, but you.
If I did, I wouldn't be up there waiting for you.
I would be letting you go.
I am wearing the dress.
I'm ready.
And maybe I didn't want to before, but I want to now.
I really think I want this.
I really wish that you didn't think.
I wish that you knew.
It's over.
You can all go home.
It's over.
So over.
